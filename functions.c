//functions in c are similar to an y of the programming language they are used to reduce the repeations of the code
// but here there are two types of calling methods 
// call by value 
// call through reference /
// 1--> Call by value meaning both the local and the global variable have different addresses and will be acting different 
// 2--> Call by reference meaning that the functions parameters and the main() function values have the same address
